          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my personal website. It's my pleasure to introduce myself to everyone. My name is Le Wang, a positive and warm person who you should know. I was born in northwestern China and came to Canada in 2013. I gained my master's degree in Human Nutritional Science from University of Manitoba in 2016 and started to pursue my career in clinical research since then. Eventually, I achieved the certificate of Certified Clinical Research Professional from the Society of Clinical Research Associates (SoCRA) in February 2021. Now, I'm on my way to the new destination of data analyst. Meanwhile, I'm fascinated with learning practical skills such as website design and video edit.</p>
